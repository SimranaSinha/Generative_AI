# Assignment 2: ExcelGPT – AI_Reply Function

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates the use of a custom **AI_Reply** function inside Microsoft Excel to perform AI-powered tasks directly within a spreadsheet. The goal is to showcase how generative AI can support common business and analytics workflows such as formatting, data analysis, content creation, data cleaning, translation, summarization, and classification.

The assignment focuses on **prompt design**, **use case diversity**, and **responsible API usage**, rather than building a standalone application.

---

## Objectives

* Integrate generative AI capabilities into Excel using a custom function
* Design clear and effective prompts for different business use cases
* Demonstrate multiple AI applications within a single workbook
* Follow security best practices by protecting API keys

## Tools & Technologies

* Microsoft Excel (Mac)
* Excel VBA / Custom Function: `AI_Reply`
* OpenAI API (API key removed before submission)

---

## Workbook Structure

### 1. Configuration Section

Includes the following parameters:

* API Key (removed and replaced with a placeholder before submission)
* Default Model
* Temperature setting

> **Note:** The API key has been intentionally removed for security reasons. Any visible errors are authentication-related and not due to incorrect logic or formulas.

### 2. AI Use Case Examples

The workbook demonstrates multiple AI-driven use cases using the `AI_Reply` function:

* **Formatting**
  Convert numeric values into professional financial formats

* **Data Analysis**
  Identify trends and insights from a sequence of sales values

* **Content Creation**
  Generate a professional customer-facing email

* **Problem Solving**
  Suggest workflow optimization strategies

* **Data Cleaning**
  Standardize inconsistent product codes

* **Translation**
  Translate short business text into another language with emojis

* **Summarization**
  Condense a business paragraph into concise insights

* **Classification**
  Classify customer sentiment based on a review

* **Data Transformation**
  Convert dates into a standardized format

---

### 3. Observations Section

This section evaluates the **benefits and shortcomings** of using the `AI_Reply` function in Excel.

**Benefits include:**

* Automation of repetitive and manual tasks
* Support for diverse business and analytics use cases
* Improved productivity for non-technical users

**Shortcomings include:**

* Dependence on clear prompt design for high-quality output
* Need for human review for critical decisions
* Reliance on internet connectivity and API availability

---

## Security Considerations

* The API key was removed prior to submission and replaced with a placeholder value
* Result cells were generated before key removal
* Authentication errors visible in the sheet confirm correct API handling without exposing credentials

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Prompt engineering inside spreadsheet workflows
* Applying generative AI to real-world business tasks
* Understanding limitations and risks of AI-generated outputs
* Implementing secure practices when working with APIs
