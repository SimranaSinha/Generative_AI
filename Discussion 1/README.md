# Discussion 1: GenAI_Triage

---

## Overview

This discussion explores the use of Generative AI models for medical triage decision support. The goal is to evaluate how large language models perform when assisting with patient triage, assess their strengths and limitations, and analyze the impact of prompt design on output quality, consistency, and safety.

The discussion emphasizes AI as a decision-support tool rather than a replacement for clinicians, focusing on human-in-the-loop workflows and responsible deployment considerations.

## Objectives

- Evaluate the potential benefits of AI-assisted medical triage  
- Identify risks, limitations, and failure modes of LLM-based triage systems  
- Compare outputs across different models and prompt designs  
- Analyze how prompt engineering affects reasoning quality and consistency  
- Discuss ways to improve triage reliability using human oversight and better data inputs

## Key Takeaways

- GenAI shows promise in supporting triage prioritization and reasoning consistency  
- Prompt design has a strong influence on safety and output quality  
- AI systems should support clinicians, not operate autonomously  
- Human oversight remains essential for edge cases and ethical decision-making  
- Additional structured clinical data would significantly improve model performance

## Conclusion

This discussion highlights both the potential and the limitations of using Generative AI for medical triage. While LLMs can assist with structured reasoning and prioritization, their effectiveness depends heavily on prompt design, data quality, and human oversight. A carefully designed human-in-the-loop approach is critical for safe and reliable deployment in healthcare settings.
