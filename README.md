# Lab 2 - Prompting Strategies

This lab demonstrates how different prompting strategies influence the reasoning quality, consistency, and accuracy of large language model outputs. The notebook focuses on applying structured prompts to the same problem and analyzing how model behavior changes based on prompt design and temperature settings.

The lab emphasizes practical experimentation with prompting techniques rather than application development.

## Contents

- ` Lab_2_Module_3_Prompting_Strategies_in_Practice_Simran.ipynb ` — Jupyter notebook exploring multiple prompting strategies and response analysis

## Key Concepts
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Self-consistency and temperature effects

## Lab 3 – GenAI-Assisted Decision Making in the Beer Game

This lab explores the use of Generative AI as a decision-support tool in the Beer Game supply chain simulation. The focus is on understanding how prompt design and human–AI collaboration influence ordering decisions, cost behavior, and stability over multiple simulation runs.

Rather than modifying the simulation logic, the lab emphasizes prompt experimentation, comparative analysis, and evaluation of GenAI-assisted versus manual decision-making.

### Contents
- ` M4_Lab2_GenAI_BeerGame_V1.ipynb ` — Jupyter notebook exploring GenAI-assisted decision making and prompt-based order planning in the Beer Game
- Part 1 — Prompt engineering experiments using three strategies (Baseline, Cost-Aware Conservative, Risk-Constrained Data-Driven)
- Part 2 — Manual vs. GenAI-assisted order planning comparison
- Reports — PDF summaries of findings for Part 1 and Part 2
- CSV / Excel files — Combined experimental results

### Key Concepts
- Prompt engineering for operational decision-making
- GenAI as a decision-support system
- Cost and variability analysis in supply chains
- Human–AI collaboration in multi-period environments
