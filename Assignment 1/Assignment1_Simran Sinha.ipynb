The Sun, which is the natural light source, emits light that's made of various colors. These colors are depicted in the rainbow and represent different wavelengths - red light has the longest wavelength, and blue and violet lights have the shortest wavelengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "As sunlight reaches the Earth’s atmosphere, it comes into contact with these small molecules. Because blue and violet light have the shortest wavelengths and are scattered in all directions by the oxygen and nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere. Blue and violet light gets to our eyes from all directions of the sky, not just straight from the sun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sure, you might wonder \"why isn't the sky violet then?\", because violet light is scattered more than blue. The reason is that our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us with less violet light to start with. \n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, if the Sun is lower in the sky, such as at sunrise or sunset, the light has to pass through more atmosphere. This causes almost all of the blue and violet light to be scattered out, leaving the longer wavelengths like red, orange, and yellow. That’s why we see beautiful colors at sunrise and sunset.\n",

            "2. Coffee grounds (of your preference)\n",

            "Procedure:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Prepare the Coffee Maker**: First, make sure the coffee maker is clean and free of any old coffee grounds. If your coffee maker has been left unused for a lengthy period, run a cycle of water without any coffee to clean it out.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Add Water**: Open the coffee maker's water chamber and pour in cold water. The rough guide is 6 ounces (178 ml) of water for each cup of coffee. However, you can adjust this depending on your preference for how strong or weak you want your coffee.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Insert a Coffee Filter**: Place a coffee filter in the filter basket. Standard white coffee filters work fine, but there are also metal and gold mesh filters available.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Measure Coffee Grounds**: The general ratio is 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds for every 6 ounces of water. But, again, you can tweak this to your personal taste. Spoon the coffee grounds into the filter.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Begin Brewing**: Close the lid of the coffee maker and switch it on. It should start producing a gurgling sound, indicating that the heating element is working to boil the water and drip it through the coffee grounds.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Wait**: The brewing process will take a few minutes, so be patient. The coffee will trickle into the pot below.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Serve**: Once the brewing sound finishes and the flow of coffee stops, your coffee is ready. Turn off the coffee maker, remove the coffee pot, and pour the coffee into your mug. If desired, add sugar, milk, or cream to taste, and stir using a spoon.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Clean Up**: Remember to dispose of the used coffee filter and grounds, and rinse out the coffee pot ready for the next use.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, coffee tastes best when consumed fresh, so aim to drink it once it's made. If you want to keep the coffee warm without overcooking it, consider transferring it to a thermos or insulated flask. Enjoy!\n"
