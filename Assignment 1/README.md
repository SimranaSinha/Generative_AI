# Assignment 1 — Generative AI

This repository contains **Assignment 1** for a Generative AI course.  
The assignment demonstrates the fundamentals of **role-based prompting** and making a basic **OpenAI API call** using a chat model.

The work is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity and step-by-step execution.

---

## Objectives

- Understand the role structure in chat-based models (System, User, Assistant)
- Write a custom prompt
- Generate responses using the OpenAI API
- Observe how prompt roles influence model behavior

## Notebook Description

**Assignment1_Simran Sinha.ipynb** includes:
- Explanation of prompt roles
- A custom prompt example
- OpenAI ChatCompletion API call
- Generated assistant response output

The notebook is organized sequentially for easy understanding.

## Setup

### Install dependency
pip install openai

Set OpenAI API Key

- Mac / Linux
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

- Windows (PowerShell)
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"

Restart the terminal after setting the key.

How to Run
- Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Navigate to the Assignment 1 folder
- Open Assignment1_Simran Sinha.ipynb
- Run the cells in order
The output will display the assistant’s generated response.

Key Learnings
- Prompt structure strongly affects response quality
- System instructions help control tone and behavior
- Clear prompts lead to more consistent outputs
